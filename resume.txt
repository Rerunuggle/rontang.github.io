Project Experience
Highly Cited Researcher Prediction Modelling
University of Sydney - Advanced Analytics and Planning
Aug 2023 – Oct 2023
•	Collaborated with a diverse team to design and implement a predictive model for identifying future Clarivate Highly Cited Researchers with agile methodologies.
•	Applied and evaluated multiple supervised learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree classifiers.
•	Took primary responsibility for data preprocessing, outlier detection, and pruning to elevate model reliability and performance.
•	Tuned hyperparameters and optimised the Gradient Boosting model to maximise predictive performance.
•	Achieved a final model accuracy of 87%.

Canine Heart & Lung Auscultation Model
Jacaranda Flame Consulting – University of Sydney, School of Veterinary Science
Jun 2024 – Jul 2024
•	Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to enhance a canine auscultation training model for the School of Veterinary Science with agile methodologies.
•	Contributed to full-stack development, including a USYD-branded website for project presentation, application distribution, and website deployment on GitHub.
•	Implemented Bluetooth communication protocols to communicate with custom hardware, including an Arduino R4 Wi-Fi board and bone conduction speakers.
•	Delivered a functional and affordable canine model with 90% lower cost.

Data-Driven Optimal Power Flow for Islanded Microgrids
University of Sydney
Mar 2024 – Nov 2024
•	Conducted a thesis project focused on developing a data-driven approach to Optimal Power Flow in islanded microgrids. The aim was to provide real-time and reliable solutions for the unstable and fluctuating power conditions introduced by the renewable microturbines.
•	Applied advanced reinforcement learning algorithms including MACPO (Multi-Agent Constrained Policy Optimisation) and SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) to model under operational constraints.
•	Demonstrated significant performance and computational efficiency compared to traditional OPF solutions.
•	Gained concrete experience in the implementation, tuning, and deployment of machine learning algorithms in power systems, including environment simulation, policy evaluation, and multi-constraint handling.
•	Acquired proficiency in cross-domain integration of ML methods into real-world engineering problem.
